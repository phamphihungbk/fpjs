## ðŸŽƒFunctional Programming Javascript

The repository to practice functional programming with Javascript.

### Javascript knowledge:

**Currying:**
Currying simply means evaluating functions with multiple arguments and
decomposing them into a sequence of functions with a single argument.

**Closure:**
A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent
function has closed.

**Hoisting:**
JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to
move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their
scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting allows functions to be safely
used in code before they are declared.

### FP Principles and Practice:

- Immutability
- Disciplined state
- Pure functions and no side effects/disciplined states
- First class functions and high order functions
- Type systems
- Referential transparency

### Javascript Debug notes:

- console.assert(false condition, "message")
- console.dir(): used for dom element
- console.log({object})
- console.table(map): used for object, map
- console.time - console.endTime: time measurement
